# iostream_python

Hi!This is funny python module, which can add cin and cout from C++!
You should make a new variable with "inout" type, and use "cin>>" for input the variable, and "cout<<" for print the variable

Also you can use the endl!

E.X:
from iostream import *

a=inout()
b=inout()
cin >> a >> b
cout << inout(int(a)+int(b)) << endl

Sorry for my EnglishğŸ¤¡
