# iostream_python

Hi!This is funny python module, which can add cin and cout from C++!
You should make a new variable with "inout" type, and use "cin>>" for input the variable, and "cout<<" for print the variable

Also you can use the endl!

E.X:

	from iostream import *
	a=inout()
	b=inout()
	cin >> a >> b
	cout << int(a)+int(b) << endl


note:
cin is working how input(), long story short, you should press enter, for input next variable
Sorry for my EnglishğŸ¤¡
